# Heart Disease Classification

## Project Overview

The `heart-disease-classification` project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. The goal is to create a reliable classification model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of heart disease.

## Dataset

- **Source:** The dataset contains patient information, including attributes like age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, and other relevant medical indicators.
- **Data:** The target variable is binary, indicating whether the patient has heart disease (1) or not (0).

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Data Handling:**
  - `Pandas` for data manipulation and preprocessing.
  - `NumPy` for numerical operations.
- **Data Visualization:**
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for visualizing data distributions and relationships.
- **Machine Learning:**
  - `scikit-learn` for building and evaluating classification models.
  - `XGBoost` and `LogisticRegression` for model comparison and selection.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing:

- **Handling Missing Values:**
  - Imputed missing data and handled outliers to ensure a clean dataset.
  
- **Feature Scaling:**
  - Applied normalization to numerical features to improve model performance.

- **Feature Selection:**
  - Used correlation analysis and feature importance metrics to select the most relevant features for the model.

### Model Development:

- **Classification Algorithms:**
  - Tested various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to determine the best model for predicting heart disease.
  
- **Model Training:**
  - Trained the models on the preprocessed dataset and performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize their performance.

### Model Evaluation:

- **Accuracy and AUC:**
  - Evaluated the models using metrics like accuracy, AUC (Area Under the Curve), precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their effectiveness.
  
- **Confusion Matrix:**
  - Used a confusion matrix to analyze the classification performance and identify any misclassifications.

- **Example Usage:**
  ```python
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
  
  model = RandomForestClassifier()
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)
  predictions = model.predict(X_test)
  ```

## Results

The classification model achieved high accuracy and AUC, effectively identifying patients at risk of heart disease. The RandomForestClassifier and XGBoost models demonstrated strong performance, with XGBoost slightly outperforming others in most metrics.

## Conclusion

This project successfully developed a robust model for heart disease classification. The model's high accuracy and reliability make it a valuable tool for early detection, potentially aiding in the prevention and treatment of heart disease.

## Future Work

- **Advanced Feature Engineering:**
  - Explore the creation of new features based on domain knowledge to further improve model accuracy.
  
- **Ensemble Methods:**
  - Implement ensemble techniques to combine multiple models for even better predictive performance.
  
- **Deployment:**
  - Deploy the model as a web application to make predictions accessible to healthcare professionals in real-time.
